    <h1>“We Are Your Retribution”: Trump’s Threat to the American People</h1>

    <p>In March 2023, Donald Trump stood before a cheering crowd at CPAC and delivered a line that sent shockwaves through the democratic world: <strong>“I am your retribution.”</strong></p>

    <p>That statement wasn’t aimed at corrupt elites or foreign powers. It was aimed at everyday Americans—journalists, protesters, union workers, educators, immigrants, LGBTQ+ citizens—anyone who dares to disagree.</p>

    <p>Retribution isn’t policy. It’s punishment. And when a political movement pledges revenge instead of reform, democracy is on life support.</p>

    <p>Trump’s MAGA coalition continues to echo his authoritarian tone. Sen. J.D. Vance has questioned universal suffrage. Rep. Paul Gosar called for public executions of political opponents.</p>

    <p>This is not rhetoric. It’s the normalization of state violence—wrapped in red, white, and blue.</p>

    <h2>Your Rights in the Crosshairs</h2>

    <p>The 1st Amendment guarantees freedom of speech and peaceful assembly. MAGA leaders routinely demonize journalists, label protesters “terrorists,” and pass laws to criminalize dissent.</p>

    <p>The 14th Amendment ensures equal protection under the law. Trump’s calls to end birthright citizenship threaten to shred it completely.</p>

    <p>The 4th and 5th Amendments protect against unlawful search, seizure, and prosecution. Project 2025 would grant the president unchecked power over federal law enforcement.</p>

    <p>This isn’t hypothetical. It’s happening. In public. In plain sight.</p>

    <h2>Silence Is Permission</h2>

    <p>Americans don’t need permission to resist tyranny. We only need the will.</p>

    <p>Democracy doesn’t die quietly. It dies while the crowd cheers—and the rest of us wait for someone else to act.</p>

    <p>That’s why we built this site. To document. To expose. To resist.</p>
